# Notes

I'll be taking notes as I work on this problem.

- In HTTP/REST, the PATCH verb should be used for partial updates. What the PUT verb does is a full replacement of a HTTP resource, which isn't what the challenge proposes. So, I've changed the docs to mention PATCH instead of PUT
  - I'll leave both verbs working as partial update mechanisms, but it definitely devies from the REST standard
